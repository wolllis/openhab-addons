# OpenGarage Binding

The OpenGarage binding allows you to control an OpenGarage controller (https://opensprinkler.com/product/opengarage/) using OpenHAB


## Supported Things

Opengarage controllers from https://opensprinkler.com/product/opengarage/ are supported.

## Discovery

Auto-discover is not currently supported. 
You need to manually add a new item using its IP address.

* hostname - The hostname of the OpenGarage controller. Typically you'd use an IP address such as `192.168.0.5` for this field.
* port - the port the OpenGarage is listening on. Defaults to port 80
* refresh - The frequency with which to refresh information from the OpenGarage controller specified in seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
* password - The password to send commands to the OpenGarage. Defaults to "opendoor"
