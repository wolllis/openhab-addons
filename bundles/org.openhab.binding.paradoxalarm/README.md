# Paradox Alarm System binding

This binding is intended to provide basic support for Paradox Alarm system.
Currently the binding does not support active communication, i.e. you cannot change states (arming, disarming). The intention is to use it only for monitoring of your security system.
With the power of openHAB this binding can be used for complex decision rules combining motion/magnetic sensor or whole partitions states with different scenarios.

Examples: 

* All partitions are armed, therefore there is no one at home. 
* Window is opened for more than 10 minutes and temperature outside is bellow XXX degrees, send mail/any other supported notification to particular people.

## Supported Paradox panels/systems

Currently binding supports the following panels: EVO192, EVO48(not tested), EVO96(not tested)

## Supported things

| Thing      | Thing Type | Description                                                    |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ip150      | Bridge     | The bridge is used to communicate with IP150 ethernet module attached to Paradox security system.|
| panel      | Thing      | this is representation of Paradox panel. Has the general information about the main panel module, i.e. serial number, firmware/hardware/software versions, panel type, etc...|
| partition  | Thing      | provides "state"(armed, disarmed, in alarm), "partition label" and "additional states" are aggregated additional states which are booleans (ready to arm, trouble, force instant arm ready, etc...)|
| zone       | Thing      | Paradox zone. Can be anything - magnetic, motion or any other opened/closed sensor. State channel is contact, low battery and is tampered channels are switch, label is String |

## Things configuration

### IP150 bridge parameters

| Parameter         | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| refresh           | Value is in seconds. Defines the refresh interval when the binding polls from paradox system.|
| ip150Password     | The password to your IP150 (not your panel PIN).|
| pcPassword        | The code 3012 setting. Default value is 0000.|
| ipAddress         | IP address of your IP150.|
| port              | The port used for data communication. Default value is 10000.|
| panelType         | Optional parameter. Will be used if discovery does not identify the panel. Otherwise provide EVO48, EVO96, EVO192, etc...|
| reconnectWaitTime | Value is in seconds. The time to wait before a reconnect occurs after socket timeout.|
| maxPartitions     | Optional parameter which sets maximum partitions to use during refresh. If not set, maximum allowed amount from panelType will be used.|
| maxZones          | Optional parameter which sets maximum zones to use during refresh. If not set, maximum allowed amount from panelType will be used.|
