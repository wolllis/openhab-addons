## Firmware

To utilize all features the binding requires firmware version 1.5.2 or newer.
This should be available for all devices.
Older versions work in general, but have impacts to functionality (e.g. no events for battery powered devices).

The binding displays a WARNING in the log if the firmware is older.
It also informs you when an update is available.
Use the device' web ui or the Shelly App to perform the update.

## Discovery

The binding uses mDNS to discover the Shelly devices.
They periodically announce their presence, which is used by the binding to find them on the local network.

Make sure to wake-up battery powered devices (press the button inside the device), so that they show up on the network.
Sometimes you need to run the manual discovery multiple times until you see all your devices.

Important: The IP address should not be changed after the device is added to openHAB.
This can be achieved by

- assigning a static IP address or
- using DHCP and setup the router to always assign the same IP address to the device

### Password Protected Devices

The Shelly devices can be configured to require authentication through a user id and password.
In this case you need to set these values in the Thing configuration after approving the Inbox entry.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has the following configuration options:

| Parameter      |Description                                                       |Mandatory|Default                                         |

## Channels

### General Notes

- channels `input` and `input1`/`input2` get only updated with firmware 1.5.6+.
- channel button: Short push and long push events require firmware version 1.5.6+.
- Use the channel `rollerpos` only if you need the inverted roller position, otherwise use the `control` channel with item type `Number`
- The different devices have different types of power meters, i.e. different sets of channels.

Every device has a channel group `device` with the following channels:

|Group     |Channel      |Type     |read-only|Desciption                                                                       |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|device    |uptime       |Number   |yes      |Number of seconds since the device was powered up                                |
|          |wifiSignal   |Number   |yes      |WiFi signal strength (4=excellent, 3=good, 2=not string, 1=unreliable, 0=none)   |
|          |alarm        |Trigger  |yes      |Most recent alarm for health check                                               |


### Alarm Events

The binding provides health monitoring functions for the device.
When an alarm condition is detected the channel alarm gets triggered and provides one of the following alarm types:

|Event Type|Description|
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|WEAK_SIGNAL |An alarm is triggered when RSSI is < -80, which indicates an unstable connection.                                |
|RESTARTED   |The device has been restarted. This could be an indicator for a firmware problem.                                |
|OVER_TEMP   |The device is over heating, check installation and housing.                                                      |
|OVER_LOAD   |An over load condition has been detected, e.g. from the roller motor.                                            |
|OVER_POWER  |Maximum allowed power was exceeded. The relay was turned off.                                                    |
|LOAD_ERROR  |Device reported a load problem.                                                                                  |
|LOW_BATTERY |Device reported a load problem.                                                                                  |

A new alarm will be triggered on a new condition or every 5 minutes if the condition persists.

```
rule "Shelly Alarm"
when
    Channel "shelly:shelly1:XXXXXX:device#alarm" triggered
then
    logInfo("Shelly", "n alarm condition was detected:" + receivedEvent.toString())
end

### Shelly 2.5 - roller mode (thing-type: shelly25-roller)

The Shelly 2.5 includes 2 meters, one for each channel.
However, it doesn't make sense to differ power consumption for the roller moving up vs. moving down.
For this the binding aggregates the power consumption of both relays and includes the values in "meter1".

Please note that the settings of channel group color are only valid in color mode and vice versa for white mode.
The current firmware doesn't support the timestamp report for the meters.
In this case "n/a" is returned.
Maybe an upcoming firmware release adds this attribute, then the correct value is returned;
