     * @param off the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes read.
     * @param timeoutMSecs the maximum duration of this read before throwing a TimeoutException.
     * @return the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *         <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end
